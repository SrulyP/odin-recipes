    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This cheesecake recipe was created by me. 
        Well, actually it was first created by my grandmother, and my mother tweaked the recipe to her liking, and then I tweaked it to my liking.
        I made the recipe healthier than what it originally was by removing most of the sugars, and adding moisture by using other ingredients to replace the lack of sugar.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>¼th cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking power</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour</li>
        <li>½ cup orange juice or 1 large organge</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>500-gram farmer cheese or tvorog</li>
        <li>2 cups Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cake crusts</li>
        <li>200-gram cookies (any flavor)</li>
        <li>2 pie crusts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°.</li>
        <li>Separate the eggs, putting the whites into a mixing bowl and the egg yolks into a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Start beating the egg whites, adding an eighth cup of sugar (little by little) until it forms stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Start beating the egg yolks in another bowl, adding the rest of the sugar until it becomes a color similar to that of a lemon. (Note, this will not form stiff peakes). </li>
        <li>Mix in the baking powder, vanilla extract, flour, orange juice, milk, farmer cheese, and Greek yogurt, to the egg yolk mixture.</li>
        <li>Once it is all incorporated, fold in the egg whites until it is all incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheesecake batter into 2 cake crusts and then grate cookies into small bits, covering the cheesecakes.</li>
        <li>Bake the cheesecakes in the oven for 45-55 minutes at 350°, depending on your oven.</li>
        <li>Check on the cheesecakes at the 45-minute mark, shaking them to see if they are still raw. If they wobble a bit in the center then they are fully baked, if they wobble a lot then they need a bit more time. </li>
        <li>Once they are finished baking, let them cool on the counter or in the oven with the door open for 30-45 minutes (with the oven turned off).</li>
        <li>Place them in the fridge for a couple of hours, and enjoy chilled!</li>
    </ul>
